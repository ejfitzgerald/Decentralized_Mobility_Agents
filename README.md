## Tech Stack overview

Software stack comprises of [playground.digital.auto
](https://digitalauto.netlify.app), Bosch SSI & IBM Decentralized infrasrtucure along with Fetch.ai [Agentverse](https://fetch.ai/docs/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) and [DeltaV](https://fetch.ai/docs/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) platforms. API are enabled by the SDV software stack, mainly [Eclipse.LEDA](https://github.com/eclipse-leda) and [Eclipse.Kuksa](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val) and ROS/[DDS](https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds) to enable vehicle applications. SSI software stack enables decentralized identity (DID) and Fetch.ai agents enable discoverable services enhanced by natural language based communication medium.
