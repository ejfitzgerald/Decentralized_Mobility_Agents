# Fetch.ai Tech Stack

Welcome to the exciting world of Fetch AI Agents. There are 3 main parts to the Fetch.ai technology stack that you will want to understand.

1. The [uAgents](https://github.com/fetchai/uagents) library, is our python based library that allows you to build and communicate with other agents
2. The [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai) is our platform for discovering and hosting these agents
3. [DeltaV](https://deltav.agentverse.ai) is our AI based search and reasoning engine for agents.

## Where to start

Our [Documentation](https://fetch.ai/docs) site has numerous example and guides to help you set started. We have highlighted a few below to help you get up and running as fast a possible:

### :bulb: Stage 0. Looking for inspiration! 

Before getting stuck into the details of building and deploying AI agents, you might want to review our set of [Integrations & Examples](https://fetch.ai/integrations). We even have a number of [Mobility Agent Examples](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents/tree/main/integrations/mobility-integrations) available from the [uAgents](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents/) directly.

### :wrench: Stage 1. Building an AI agent 

To get started building an AI agent we recommend you have a look throw the following guide:

### :rocket: Stage 2. Deploying your agent 

Typically after building your AI agent, you will want to run and deploy it. This can happen one of two ways.

1. You host it directly on Agentverse - if you choose to do this then we recommend that you follow our [Hosting Guide](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent)

2. You host it from your local machine - if you choose to do this then you will probably want an Agentverse Mailbox account. Please have a look at the [Mailbox Guide](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/utilising-the-mailbox)

### :mega: Stage 3. You have built and deployed your AI Agent and want to start connecting it to DeltaV 

In order to expose your Agent to the platform you will need to create services for each of your agents. The [Services Guide](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) will be helpful when you do this

Then you might want to review the [DeltaV Chat Guide](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/deltav/deltav-chat-interface) or simply try it out directly from [DeltaV](https://deltav.agentverse.ai)
